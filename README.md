# Event Timeline Viewer

## Stage 1: Basic Layout Setup

This project is designed to visualize chronological events using a vertical timeline interface.

- A `<header>` with a logo and a theme toggle button (light/dark mode).
- An empty `<nav>` for future filter options.
- A `<section>` with `id="timeline"` to hold event markers.
- A `<div>` with `id="modal"` reserved for future pop-up modals.
- Semantic HTML tags like `<main>`, `<article>`, and `<figure>` to structure content meaningfully.

This layout serves as the foundation for dynamic event loading, interaction, and filtering in later stages.
